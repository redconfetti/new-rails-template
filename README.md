# Rails Template

This is my template for new Rails projects. This template is very opininated,
implementing the specific configurations I prefer in any and all projects.
## Configuration

* Rails
  * API-Only
  * Webpack with Vue
  * Rspec with FactoryBot
* EditorConfig
## Customizing

See [Generating A New Rails Project][1] for additional options for configuring an
existing Rails application with certain features that are specific to your project.
